# Word Search Battle
Word Search Battle is a game I've been working on that is basically Word Search multiplayer.

If you'd like to spin up your own server, you can follow the docker compose file and put your secret keys (for database, and jwt)
jwt-key.txt
postgres-p.txt
postgres-u.txt

Currently theres no setup script for postgres, youll manually need to create a several tables (you can look at the API database contexts for what fields need to be done), This will be provided in the future!
